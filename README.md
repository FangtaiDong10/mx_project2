flask + vue3 + deployment to AWS 

### Project Description
The experience I gained from Moxue Education Technology Pty. Ltd. as a junior software developer
provides me with solid knowledge of how to develop an online course web application from scratch.
I used Vue.js composition API and Naive-UI component library to create a dashboard to help users
book course online. This dashboard's backend is developed by python flask architecture and has
been deployed to the AWS EC2 instance with S3 files upload and data management. From this
project, I get experience of:
1. Use Vite tool to quickly create a Vue project.
2. Use Volar extension server to quickly test project process.
3. Install Naivie-ui to import components.
4. Git and Github version control.
5. Design backend model and gathering users' requirements.
6. Use Vue Router and Axios to handle HTTP requests.
7. Use Pinia to complete state management.
8. Set .env file.
9. use Axios interceptor to complete request.
10. Complete users authorization.
11. Organize src folder.
12. Use Postman to test backend APIs and use Vue to handle data transfer by JavaScript.
13. Front End Page Design: Data table, Pagination with filter, Information description, Naive UI
